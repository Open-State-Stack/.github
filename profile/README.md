# OpenStateStack  

> **Sovereign-by-Design Digital Infrastructure**  
> A modular, privacy-preserving, and globally interoperable platform for digital governance.  

## 🌍 Vision  
OpenStateStack (OSS) enables governments to deliver secure, efficient, and citizen-first digital services. Its architecture balances **sovereignty, interoperability, and scalability**, solving the paradox between **national control** and **global connectivity**.  

## 🏛 Core Principles  
- **Modularity** – Deploy independent, reusable **Building Blocks** (identity, payments, registries, messaging).  
- **Privacy by Design** – Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) at every layer ensure verification without exposing sensitive data.  
- **Interoperability First** – Standardized APIs and protocols connect agencies, nations, and legacy systems.  
- **Decentralized Trust** – Immutable blockchain-based record keeping; no single point of control.  
- **Scalability** – Layer 2 ZK-Rollups (Ethrex) support nationwide and cross-border services.  

## 🧩 Building Blocks  

- **Identity Block** – Authentication, authorization, passkeys, ZKP-based verification.  
- **Payments Block** – Multi-rail payments (bank transfers, wallets, CBDC, vouchers) with real-time fraud prevention.  
- **Registries Block** – Land, business, civil, and trade registries tokenized with blockchain transparency.  
- **Messaging Block** – Secure notifications, confirmations, and inter-agency communication.  
- **Consent & Privacy Block** – Cryptographic consent receipts, attribute registries, and regulatory tagging.  
- **Low-Code Block** – Visual app builder (Budibase + Directus + n8n) for rapid deployment of compliant government apps.  

## ⚙️ Architecture  

- **L1 Settlement Layer (Ethereum-compatible)** – Source of truth, finality, Solidity contracts.  
- **L2 ZK-Rollup (Ethrex)** – Scalable, privacy-preserving execution in Rust zkVM.  
- **Application Modules** – eID, eInvoicing, Land Registry and others.  
- **Sovereign Rollups** – Country-specific Layer 2s with optional local data availability committees.
